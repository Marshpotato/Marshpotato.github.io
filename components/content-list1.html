                        When I said I didn’t want to be alone anymore, this
                        isn’t what I meant. I watched this boy, around my age I
                        think, saunter in like it's nobody’s business and plop
                        himself on MY couch. I mean, who does that? Whatever.
                        With one last look at him, I head back upstairs into my
                        room. The first few days were rough. I would be in the
                        bathroom, and he would just walk in, but as soon as I
                        close the curtains suddenly he freaks out and leaves. As
                        if he wasn’t the one who just barged in uninvited. I’ve
                        seen and heard his late nights, screaming into a mini
                        flat television about ‘heals?’ I don’t know. I’ve seen a
                        fair share of sick people in my life, and he seemed
                        perfectly healthy, besides his late nights. I guess
                        that’s the benefit of moving out, no parents to tell you
                        to go to bed.
                      </span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>
                        I glanced out the window, my foot tapping against the
                        floor. The boy is taking his sweet time in the damn
                        bathroom and he’s cutting it very close. I have half a
                        mind to just barge in. Just before I knock, I hear an “I
                        know, I know” from the bathroom. Finally, the door
                        swings open, and out comes the boy. The bathroom is
                        foggy, but on the mirror, there are small words and a
                        drawing. I see our house and a smiley face. Finally the
                        message, “thanks for having me, I hope we can be friends
                        one day.” I can’t fight the small smile that cracks
                        through my face, although it quickly hides once I hear
                        him yelling from across the hall at his mini tv
                        again.&nbsp;
                      </span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>
                        I don’t know exactly when, but I was settled in his
                        presence. I guess that’s just what happens when you
                        cohabitate. You learn about each other’s routines and it
                        becomes like clockwork. At sundown I get the bathroom
                        uninterrupted. For the most part, he’s even considerate
                        of noise after 9pm. We don’t talk much. That’s fine by
                        me. I was never much of a talker anyway. However, I did
                        learn his name was David. He didn’t really go to school
                        much, but he did spend a lot of time on his television,
                        and when bills came in, he didn’t seem to break a sweat.
                        The thing I appreciated most about David was that he
                        always respected my space. Even as he brought in new
                        things for our house, I sometimes couldn’t understand,
                        but at least he always left my stuff alone… and that was
                        good enough for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      </span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>
                        As the days progressed, we grew closer. “Hey, I’m back,”
                        David would call out as he came home, full bags in hand.
                        “Hello” I would say back. Although that seemed to be the
                        end of our conversations on a daily basis. I think, when
                        he has a particularly hard day, he appreciates my
                        company. One time I walked past the couch, and he sat
                        there curled up on the couch, a little pathetic
                        honestly. We all have those days. But I’ll never forget,
                        besides being muffled by the sound of a throw pillow he
                        bought, he said “Please. Come sit with me. I don’t want
                        to be left alone right now.” I nodded before walking
                        back around and sitting next to him. The couch sinking
                        under my weight. I pulled the blanket over his
                        shoulders. It was cold tonight. I remember the way his
                        shoulders trembled, and I had to hold the blanket down.
                        “Thank you,” His hoarse voice whispered. He sounded far
                        away. He was somewhere he didn’t want to be. A minor
                        anecdote, but ever since that incident, something
                        changed between us.&nbsp;
                      </span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>
                        He would greet me every morning after he woke up. Every
                        few days, he would come into my room and help me do some
                        chores. When his feelings were particularly large that
                        day, he would leave a drink for me on the table. He
                        would sometimes buy me gifts, like my own personal glass
                        with a little Halloween theme. Things were good between
                        us, in our home. I was happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        One of these days, David brought home a girl. He told
                        her to wait outside for a moment. He stepped in. “Hey,
                        the girl that’s about to come in. Her name is Phoebe,
                        and she’s really nice. So try not to scare her.” Without
                        even giving me the chance to process, our door is opened
                        and in she walks. She was beautiful, but that was a
                        given. David was somebody that I imagine would be quite
                        popular. I immediately didn’t like her. It was something
                        deeper than the pit in my stomach every time I saw her.
                        There was this greed in her. I couldn’t quite describe
                        it. I just remember, I felt like she was here to
                        consume. I didn’t bother remembering her name. That
                        would give her too much significance to me. Even as she
                        slowly took over my house.&nbsp;

                      <span class="content-list1-text36">
                        Just as David respects my space, I respected his.
                        Whenever she was around, I made myself scarce, mainly
                        staying in my room besides going to the bathroom and
                        occasionally the kitchen. I do know that David mentioned
                        our house rules. That parasite didn’t care. She would
                        barge into the bathroom, and then yell at me when I pull
                        the curtains closed. When I went to go get drinks, she
                        would make a huge commotion. Although I don’t regret it,
                        it certainly wasn’t my most proper moment when I sprayed
                        the faucet at her for the first time. She’s just lucky I
                        wasn’t cruel, the water was a nice temperature. However,
                        I did find that spraying her was efficient to get her to
                        stop causing problems. When the parasite yelled or made
                        a commotion, a little spray here, a little spray there,
                        the shower, the sink, anything. One time she did get mad
                        and try to burn all my things. Luckily, when David took
                        a break from his work on his computer (I learnt this is
                        what his mini tv is) he noticed what she was about to do
                        and he intervened quickly. They compromised, and he just
                        packed my things into boxes. Was I happy? No. I was a
                        stranger in my own home. For the next few days, David
                        couldn’t even look up from the floor. All he could do
                        was mutter apologies I didn’t need or want.&nbsp;

                        The parasite brought in a new stranger after all my
                        things were boxed and confined into my room. He was in
                        all black. These wooden beads wrapped around his wrists
                        and a silver necklace with a cross. I didn’t mind this
                        stranger, although I couldn’t really understand what he
                        was doing. He came into my room and sprayed his strange
                        smelling perfume, muttering words I couldn’t quite
                        catch. His eyes were trained on the book though. I
                        watched him. He was there for a while, before he left
                        and said the room had been cleansed. I don’t think he
                        did a very good job. My floors are all wet, some of my
                        boxes have droplets on them. When David came home, the
                        parasite proudly told him about the cleaner she brought
                        into my room. David was a patient person, he was very
                        kind, and I had never seen him even raise his voice when
                        I accidentally bump his things. However, the rage he
                        exuded, even I felt bad for the parasite. Their
                        discussion quickly devolved into a yelling match. This
                        felt like a lover’s quarrel I was intruding on, so I
                        stepped away, until I heard the sound of glass hitting
                        the floor. I came running down to see my glass… in
                        pieces… on the floor. The glass David bought for me. The
                        one he had filled countless times to drink alongside
                        him. On the floor. Our best memories. Our mutual
                        understanding. All reduced to shards. Finally, David
                        said the words I’ve been trying to tell her since she
                        came in. “Get. The. Fuck. Out.”&nbsp;

                        All traces of the parasite quickly vanished. It was as
                        if the nightmare was lifted. Within the day, David
                        helped unpack all my things. My home was home. David and
                        I would hang out, more of his friends would come
                        through, all of them were really nice, actually. A few
                        people were a little rude, but came around eventually,
                        or didn’t come back at all. That was fine by me. There
                        was one girl in particular, Cassandra or Cass. She was
                        really cool. She had this unique style, although my
                        family would have freaked and called her a devil
                        worshipper if they saw her. Cass taught us both a lot.
                        She was very into spiritual stuff and paranormal things.
                        Hearing her talk about it was fascinating. Even David
                        was enamoured by her words. She talked about spirits and
                        energies and hauntings. She even said she was a medium.
                        I definitely believe her. Something about the way she
                        spoke. I knew she wouldn’t lie about it. Hearing the
                        things she described, I was starting to be convinced
                        that I had the same ability. Especially when I saw this
                        big guy walk in next to her the first time we met. He
                        was really scary looking, but once he crossed the
                        threshold of the house, he looked at me and just nodded.
                        He mainly hangs out near my room when there’s too many
                        people, understandable, I do the same. Sometimes,
                        though, David and Cass would get me candles. It wasn’t
                        my birthday, but I blew them out anyway at the end of
                        the night.

                        One of these nights, when she came to hang out with us,
                        she brought over a loud box thing, and told a spirit
                        they can talk through it. They weren’t really responsive
                        though, which was weird, because David and I were
                        convinced our house was haunted. Cass kept on explaining
                        the boxes and stuff, as if talking to a child. “This is
                        stupid,” I said. “I mean, no spirit would want to talk
                        through a box that loud.” Both Cass and David sat up a
                        little straighter. They seemed surprised. I don’t know
                        why though, I thought it would be common sense. After a
                        few moments of silence, Cass and David exchanged
                        glances. “Maybe she doesn’t know that she’s dead.”

                        I felt cold hearing that. I glanced at my body, but my
                        heart felt just like that glass the parasite broke. I’m
                        dead. I’m dead. I’m dead. The thought would not leave my
                        mind, no matter how much I begged it to. My ears rang,
                        and my body trembled. I felt like somebody just dumped
                        ice cold water on me. My eyes started leaking before I
                        could tell them no. The stupid box must have picked up
                        on my whimper, because David spoke up. “You're still
                        home. You're still safe. Just a little bit different.
                        That’s okay.” His voice was soft. It was the same voice
                        he would use to coax an injured animal. The same voice
                        he used when his friends were in pain. I suppose I am
                        his friend, and I am in pain.&nbsp;

                        I felt like I had disappeared for a while. I learnt a
                        lot about myself, the things I can and can’t do, now
                        that I’m no longer tethered to a physical body. I always
                        come home though. I tell David and Cass all about my
                        adventures. She drew a really pretty picture of me.
                        David keeps it among his collage of loved ones he keeps
                        on his wall. Cass even drew one of me and David, sitting
                        together on the couch laughing. That one he keeps on his
                        bedside. No matter where I am, I still hear his
                        greetings to me. Whenever I come home, I see a glass
                        with a little ghost on it, filled and waiting for me. I
                        feel full. My heart feels warm. When I said I didn’t
                        want to be alone anymore, this is exactly what I
                        meant.&nbsp;
